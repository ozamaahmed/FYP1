i made a python back end file, i made app.py and index.html.



-> now what i need to do is 

-> write code that smartly combines subtitles

-> for videos with only auto generated subtitles, join them into one subtitle too, 

-> make a case where there are subtitles in the video, then use whisper AI to get the subtitles

-> display in the output that there are no subs for this video so, creating the subs, it takes time, then possibly show how much time it would take. 

-> make proper front end UI overall
